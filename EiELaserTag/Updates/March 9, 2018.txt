We started step one of our plan, which was to create a function that could modulate ON and OFF at a frequency of 38kHz (period of 26us). The way we did this was we used TimerSet and chose 5 ticks. That means it was set to interupt about every 13us. Then we used AssignCallback and sent it our timer interupting every 5 ticks and a function pointer that points to our switch function, LaserTagToggler. LaserTagToggler switches our global boolean, LaserTagToggle, from either true to false or false to true every time it is called. Since this function gets called every 13us the overall period is about 26us which was our goal. 
We tested this by stepping through the code and using the watch to observe a test u16 variable called ToggleOn that started at 0 and then is incremented by 1 every time the LasertagToggle get set to 1. During intilaization it gets increment to a number in the hundreds but after that nearly every time we went through the super loop (1ms) ToggleOn incremented by exactly 38. This is equivalent to 38000/s. Only once did it only increment by 37. We are quite confident that our functions are set up correctly to  modulate ON and OFF at the correct rate.
We still have not tested this out using our transmitters and receivers. We need to test that all our hardware is working. Then we have to set up the GPIOs to see if we can get our hardware working with the board. 
The next step is to see if we can write functions that can get the transmitter to output bits. We will do this by sending a bit every 5ms.
